  "description": "Aroma patches for Pretendo",
  "details": "Inkay is an Aroma/WUPS plugin that patches various Nintendo Network URLs on a Wii U to use Pretendo Network instead. It also (for the time being) bypasses SSL verification in most cases.\\n\\nInkay does not currently include the game-specific patches present in Nimble. These will be implemented soonâ„¢.\\n\\nInkay's patches are all temporary, and only applied in-memory without modifying your console. The SSL patch, while also temporary, could reduce the overall security of your console while active - this is because it no longer checks if a server is verified. However, this does not apply to the Internet Browser, where SSL still works as expected.....",
